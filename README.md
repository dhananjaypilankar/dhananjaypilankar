This is Dhananjay Pilankar, electronics engineer pass-out of 2008 batch from Mumbai University. I have over 14 years of experience when I have started managing my profile on Github. I have worked on various microcontroller architectures in my entire career right from AVR till 32-Bit ARM core. I have proficiency over FreeRTOS also. Reason for logging in to github is through my experience and coding skills help grow the open source community.
